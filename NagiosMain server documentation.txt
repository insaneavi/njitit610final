Create basic Ubuntu Box
install nagios with plugins using guide: http://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/ubuntu-how-tos/install-nagios-4-1-1-ubuntu-16-04.html
Create nagiosaccount "Nagiosadmin" with passsword
Added firewall rule to accept TCP 5666 from everyone (which will be NRPE port for Hydra-Plex)
Enabled nagios to check windows.cfg to the Nagios.cfg 
Nagios gives “Unable to get process status” when windows is enabled
-	Issue was due to changing hostname in windows.cfg and not updating rest of the the services, changed back to default
Now trying to get internal ip 192.168.1.20 to use TCP/UDP to talk to AWS Nagios, added local firewall rule to allow it
Found that the port needed from AWS to talk inside to plex box using NS++ is 12489 which forwards to 192.168.1.20
Updated the windows.cfg to monitor Plex update service which logs error if it fails, -  individual Deliverable 1
Updated the windows.cfg to monitor CPU load – Common Deliverables CPU Utilization
Updated windows.cfg to Monitor Diskspace on C drive - Common Deliverables Hard Disk Utilization
